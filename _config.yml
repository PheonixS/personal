  Welcome to the blog of Alex Kashintsev - PheonixS!
  Here, as an SRE, I'm dumping thoughts, everyday ideas,
  and tech challenges. No frills, just a space
  where musings meet microelectronics. Join me in this casual
  conversation about all things tech and the constant stream of
  thoughts I'm tossing into the digital abyss.
