This post be quite short: I published my source code [here](https://github.com/PheonixS/ShariSync). Hope somebody will find it useful ðŸ˜€

Currently burn time for the ShariSync is around 2 weeks - I fixed several issues (such as synchronization when `CONN` event missed). I published Gerber files and prototype itself.

## Inner view

Here is how it looks like inside DVD case, I wanted to stack them vertically but it does not fit - so I have to use flexible cable.

## Project renamed

Also I renamed project from `AirPlay Sync` to `ShariSync`.
