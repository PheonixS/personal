Beware of Trolls! This post become **technical** very fast ðŸ˜…
{: .notice--primary}

Because some of my friends asked me about the mini project I'm currently working here it is. I created a website for it ðŸ˜Ž

It short for the last ~3 months I was busy with repurposing old DVD player: [Harman-Kardon DVD27](/assets/pdfs/dvd_27.pdf).

You might ask me why? Well, I bought myself a set of fancy speakers - and want to connect to them using Apple Airplay 2 - so I can stream from my phone.

## Initial idea

- Repurpose DVD27 somehow to control it's fancy [VFD display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display).

- Find a way to control power source of DVD27 - it has standby mode - which is super useful because 99% of the time device will be in standby mode.

- Reverse engineer [VFD controller - PT6315](/assets/pdfs/PT6315_PrincetonTechnologyCorp.pdf) - and SPI bus in general - in order to display things I want. I had 0 experience in regards to SPI communication in the past - but according to the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) it's quite simple - and most of modern hardware (including Rapsberry PI) - supports [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface).

- Find a way to decode which button is pressed.

- Control my old receiver using [Compulink](https://github.com/jcj83429/jvc_compulink).

## Heart of the project - Shariport Sync

- [Shariport Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) which can run on Raspberry PI (even on Zero and Zero 2) and provide Airplay service.

- It can write Metadata of current track in Linux pipe - and I can parse it and do whenever I want with that data.

## What was done

- Display current track on VFD screen - I'm using unicode library to convert anything to Latin text (I found it very useful because I listen to a lot of tracks in JPOP with non-latin characters ðŸ˜Š).

- Woke up/put in standby VFD and power source - it has built in power control pin for power source, and uses separate pin for control +3V3 line of front panel.

- Receive metadata from Shariport: events like connection established, disconnect, track name.

## What is the goal

- Control everything using single PCB

## Revision 1

However my first revision of PCB (yes, I made a PCB using EasyEDA) - had incorrectly configured DIR pin ðŸ˜‚ (which is set conversion from 3V3 to 5V).

Incorrectly configured [SN74LVC1T45DBVT](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC1T45/part-details/SN74LVC1T45DBVT). Will you be able to notice what's wrong? ðŸ˜Ž

Anyway, I was able to find what's wrong with this with multimeter - I just added resistor like this (yeah, I have to cut trace a bit with scalpel as well ðŸ¤”).
