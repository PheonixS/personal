While my next PCB revision is in production I want to share some of improvements which will go to the new revision.

I want to have some kind of visual feedback that my device is powered on. I will use front panel standby LED for this purpose.

## The problem with front panel standby LED

Let's have a look on front panel schematic (Page 107 of [DVD 27 service manual](/assets/pdfs/dvd_27.pdf)):

Note how `STANDBY_LED` is controlling the LED: it's connected to bases of both transistors via the same pin! These transistors then controls mixed Green/Red LED. I had hard time to understand how it works.

## Simulation of front panel standby LED

Let's create "good enough" SPICE models for these transistors. All information is based on these 2 datasheets: [C107S](/assets/pdfs/KRC107S.PDF) and [A107S](/assets/pdfs/KRA107S.PDF).

+ RB=10 RC=0.1 RE=0.1 VCE=5.0 VBE=-0.7

```

Here is a schematic for simulation:

During my physical test - I observed if I supply 5V to `STANDBY_LED` pin - LED is lit with blue. Without any voltage - LED is red. (I don't know how they make it blue from mixing red and green).

Simulation confirms this behavior ðŸŽ‰:

- On positive half cycle of the waveform:
  - `Q1` will turn on Green.
  - `Q2` will turn on Red.
  - Mix of colors will produce blue.
- On negative half cycle of the waveform:
  - `Q1` will turn off Green.
  - `Q2` will continue to lit.
  - Only red will be lit so we will see red color.

I still don't understand however why do they need 2 transistors for this purpose. I think it's possible to use only one transistor. Maybe they want to have specific brightness of the LED?

## Front panel standby LED control

Now we know how to control front panel standby LED. We need to supply 5V to `STANDBY_LED` pin to lit the LED. We can use this pin to control LED from Raspberry PI.

Raspberry PI GPIO pins are:

- ON by default! We need to use some kind of inverter to control LED from Raspberry PI. **Default** state of the LED must be **off** while Raspberry is booting up. Otherwise we will see LED lit during boot. Later when software starts - LED will be turned off.

- 3.3V tolerant. We need to use some kind of level shifter to control LED from Raspberry PI.

Here is a simple schematic for inverter:

While testing on breadboard I used 2N2222A transistor. All works as expected:

- LED is off during boot (because Raspberry has 3.3V on the GPIO pin).
- When application is loaded - GPIO pin set to `LOW` and LED is lit blue.
- If I need I can set GPIO pin to `HIGH` and LED will be turned off.

On real PCB I will use [SN74LVC1G14DBVR](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC1G14/part-details/SN74LVC1G14DBVR) inverter.
