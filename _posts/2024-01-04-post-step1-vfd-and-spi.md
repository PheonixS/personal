My journey started with analyzing original wiring of [DVD 27](/assets/pdfs/dvd_27.pdf).

I was particularly interested in:

1. What VFD controller is on board?
2. Which protocol is used to communicate with it?
3. How to power up controller?
4. How was the VFD receiving negative power supply?

## Reverse engineering

Page 107 of service manual turns out to be a good source of information (my sincere gratitude towards Harman/Kardon engineers designing this - schematic is clear and well structured).

Let's go one by one over questions:
According to the schematic [PT6315 VFD driver](/assets/pdfs/PT6315_PrincetonTechnologyCorp.pdf) is used to control VFD.

Next question was how to communicate with controller. You probably can already tell based on the pins: 9/STB, 8/CLK, and 7/DIN. But I didn't know that at the time.

Page 1 of PT6315 datasheet describes capabilities, which are (some omitted):

> â€¢ Serial Interface for Clock, Data Input, Data Output, Strobe Pins

I have to google it tbh - because, by some reason, "Serial Interface" in my head was related to RS232 interface.

Anyway, at some point I found that Serial Interface actually mean [Serial Peripheral Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface).

## Wiring VFD controller with Raspberry PI Zero W

ALl recent Raspberry PIs supports GPIO. I found website which groups pins based on their functions - [here](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/spi).

> By default the Pi allows you to use SPI0 with chip select pins on CE0 on GPIO 8 and CE1 on GPIO 7.

GPIO pins I need to use are:

- 10 - MOSI - send data to VFD controller

- 11 - SCLK - clock

- 8 - CE0 - Chip Enable

Here they are on screenshot:

Here my first problem occurs, how to correlate CE(Chip Enable) pins with PT6315?

Turns out SPI is not a standard: is _de facto_ standard. Which means naming can drift.

**Soooo**, how do I wire it to the front panel anyway? And where to connect it?

## Thought process

Lets analyze page 107. Remember we need to find only how to control VFD controller for now.

Front port:

![Front port](/assets/images/04012024-front-port-1646.JPG){: width="350" }

VFD controller: SPI and VDD pins:

![Front port](/assets/images/04012024-1646-vfd-controller.JPG){: width="350" }

As you can see SPI port represented by the following pins on the front connector: 2/VFD_CLK, 3/VFD_DATA, 4/VFD_STB.

However I notice something strange in regards to power: VFD driver isn't connected directly to +3.3V power line, but instead it's connected via this:

![Front port power line](/assets/images/04012024-1656-front-port.JPG){: width="350" }

That mean I need to trigger pin 1/+3.3V CTL with +3.3V ðŸ™ƒ to enable front panel power supply.

Here is schematic for breadboard:

I'll continue in the next posts how code looks like and how I found that SPI0 port was actually dead on my Raspberry PI ðŸ˜‚ And how to connect negative power pins from Power supply to front panel.
