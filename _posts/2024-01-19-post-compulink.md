Control JVC RX-416V receiver via compulink.

Let's do quick recap:

- We can control VFD display.
- We know how to turn on power supply, front panel and VFD display.

Let's focus on controlling receiver. For now on I want only to control the following:

- Power on/off receiver.
- Switch input to `CD` if play was requested - because Raspberry PI and [HiFi DAC](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/dac-pro/) connected via this port.

## Reverse engineering compulink protocol

This part is heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/jcj83429/jvc_compulink) and a [brief history](http://www.johnwillis.com/2018/09/av-compu-link-unmodulated-ir-daisy.html) of Compulink.

Quote from the article:
>Compulink is a feature present in JVC stereo components in the 80's (and possibly 90's). It is a multi-master low speed TTL serial bus that runs over mono 3.5mm cables. The bus lets the stereo components control each other.

### Electrical interface

> Connection: 3.5mm tip-and-sleeve connector. < . . . > The data is connected to the tip of the 3.5mm connector.

> Voltage range: 0-5V, normally low with pull down resistors.

You might already notice some problem: Raspberry PI GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant. We need to use some kind of level shifter.

While writing this post I realized that I should have used level shifter in my early attempts to implement Compulink. Failure in doing so resulted in burning out MOSI pin on SPI0 üòÖ. (Because I was using this pin as GPIO before ).

I will use Texas Instruments [TXB0102DCUT](/assets/pdfs/2303011207_Texas-Instruments-TXB0102DCUT_C2677366.pdf). This IC is a  2-Bit Bidirectional Voltage-Level Translator. Why 2 bit? Because first bit will be used to control front panel standby LED, another bit will be used by Compulink. Please check Page 24 for "Application and Implementation" section for details about the product.

- `COMPULINK` connects to the any GPIO pin of Raspberry PI (which is 3.3V). In code snippets below, I used GPIO pin 9.
- `COMPULINK_EXT` connects to the 3.5mm female port on PCB. Signal will be converted to 5V voltage domain.

### Do we need to control output-enable pin?

>The (`OE`) input circuit is designed so that it is supplied by VCC<sub>A</sub> and when the (`OE`) input is low, all outputs are placed in the high-impedance state. To assure the high-impedance state of the outputs during power up or power down, the `OE` input pin must be tied to `GND` through a pulldown resistor and must not be enabled until VCC<sub>A</sub> and VCC<sub>B</sub> are fully ramped and stable.

All of that means we need to control OE pin of the IC from Raspberry PI üòê. One more line to control?!

Then I found this [post](https://e2e.ti.com/support/logic-group/logic/f/logic-forum/287674/txs0102-pull-up-resistor-on-oe-pin). We don't really want to control extra line from Raspberry. Instead, we can connect `OE` pin to VCC<sub>A</sub> directly. In this way we will always have output enabled.

## Compulink implementation

I wasn't able to implement compulink using Python - my assumption is that I was not able to control timing of the signal. I decided to use C++ and [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi) library. Further code samples will be in C++. CMakeLists.txt, and configuration are omitted for brevity.

```cpp
#include "compulink.h"

  std::cerr << "Error initializing WiringPi." << std::endl;

 }
 
 pinMode(COMPULINK_PORT, OUTPUT);
 // default state of port is HIGH
 digitalWrite(COMPULINK_PORT, LOW);
 
 for (;;)
 {
  sendCommand(USE_CD);

  delay(1000);
 }
}
```

## Testing

Code above sends `USE_CD` command every second.
`USE_CD` is `0xA3` or `10100011` in binary.

I used my oscilloscope to check the signal. Here is the screenshot, with annotated `0` and `1`:

I connected Raspberry PI to the receiver and it works üéâ! Receiver is turned on and input is switched to `CD` port.

Further testing will be done when I will have my PCB ready üòä
