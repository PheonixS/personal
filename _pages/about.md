Welcome to my blog!  
I'm Alex, a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) deeply passionate about microelectronics and biking.

## What to Expect

As an SRE, I optimize system reliability and delve into the world of microelectronics.
Expect insights, project highlights, and reflections on maintaining high-loaded systems.

## Beyond Tech

In my downtime, I enjoy walking with my dog and biking. These moments of simplicity provide a fresh perspective on problem-solving and creativity.
